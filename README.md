# Centralised-Loan-default-prediction
Loan default is defined as the condition when a customer **give up** giving loan to the banks they took. 
In this repository I am going to do this prediction using **RandomForestclassifier** with ensemble of 1000 trees .
Centralized Loan default prediction is done here. This is also going to be implemented in decentralized manner i,e. When data set is dispersed.
